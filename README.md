## Build Process 

After being assigned the group we decided to spend some time thinking about ideas individually, then having a group discussion about each of our top three picks. We quickly came to an agreement that the app would be a travel app, showcasing 'hidden gems' around the world. As a group of three Londoners it was clear the app should be focused primarily in London to start, with the possibility of adding more cities later.





## Issues

  * This was the first collaborative project for all three members of my group, leading to some issues at the beginning of the build process with merges on GitHub.
